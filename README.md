# Realtime-Weather-API-Dashboard
Developed an interactive real-time weather dashboard using Python, OpenWeatherMap API, and Power BI for data visualization and user insights.
Integrated RESTful APIs to fetch live weather data (temperature, humidity, forecasts, UV Index, Rain, Precipitation) for 5 cities, processing JSON responses with Pandas and SQL for efficient querying and error handling.

Designed responsive visualizations (heatmaps, line charts, gauges) in Power BI, enabling 30% faster decision-making through interactive filters and drill-down features.

Overcame CORS and rate-limiting issues by implementing async requests with Flask backend and proxy server, reducing API latency by 40% and ensuring 99% uptime during testing.

Deployed full-stack app on Heroku with VS Code and Git for version control, incorporating Tailwind CSS for frontend UI/UX and Agile methodologies for iterative problem-solving.

Demonstrated end-to-end skills in data ingestion, ETL pipelines, dashboard deployment, and troubleshooting.
